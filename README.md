# GIT Playground
This Repor is used for myself to play around with the various features.
In the same time I hopefully find the time to document my changes,
so this can also be used as reference/info material for others.
Have fun!


## Branches

I created a new branch "acceptance" and switch into it by 
```bash
git branch acceptance
git switch acceptance
```
and updated the README.md inside of this branch.
